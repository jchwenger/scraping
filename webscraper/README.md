Simple scraping device, used to grab freely available text online.   

For script use (Python 3, BeautifulSoup): `python scraper.py sourcefile.json`.  

The json files will contain the urls, cf examples. A directory named after the source json file will be produced, filled with the numbered text files, one per url.
